<h2>RING CYCLE STRUCTURE EXPLAINED</h2>
Many stories, whether it be books or movies, follow something called the ring structure—to avoid confusion, the instructions will assume the user is plotting a book—where the beginning, middle, and end of the story reflect each other. Chapter Two would reflect the penultimate chapter. This ring cycle is used in all the Harry Potter novels. This web app was designed to help writers visualize their story by showing them a chapter and the reflected version of it side by side.
