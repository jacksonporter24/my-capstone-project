const harryPotterChapters = [`Chapter 1 The Boy Who Lived:


The story starts off by describing the Dursley family. This family took pride in being as normal as possible. Mr. Dursley soon started to notice some peculiar events; the first event being a cat reading a map. Mr. Dursley assumed it to be a trick of the light, and continued on his normal way to work. At work he noticed many people wearing cloaks. Mr. Dursley didn’t think much of it, until he heard them murmur about his sister-in-law’s family, the Potters. Many other strange events took place that night, such as owls flying about during the day, and many shooting stars. The story then skips to a man named Albus Dumbledore on the Dursley’s street. The same cat Mr. Dursley noticed morphed into a woman by the name of Professor Mcgonagall. The two talk about how a seemingly evil you-know-who, or Voldemort, has gone away for good. They also talk about how he killed Harry Potter’s parents, Lily and James, but he failed to kill the little boy Harry. Then a man named Hagrid brings Harry, and leaves him with his only living family… The Dursley’s.

Chapter 2 The Vanishing Glass:

Ten years have passed. Harry, now almost eleven, has been living in a small cupboard under the stairs. Harry has been abused by the Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, as well as their only son, Dudley. Dudley is spoiled and whiny. Today is Dudley’s birthday, and he complains about getting only 37 presents this year. Harry is very self-conscience, and the only thing he likes about his appearance is a lightning shaped scar on his forehead. He is told he got that in a car crash when his parents died. The phone rings, and the babysitter for Harry had to cancel. This forces the Dursley’s to take Harry with them to the zoo. While at the zoo, the Dursley parents completely neglect Harry, so he goes to the reptile area. Much to Harry’s astonishment, he starts to have a conversation with the snake. Dudley, noticing Harry, came over and pushed Harry out of the way. As Dudley leaned against the glass, it vanished. The Dursley’s punished Harry for the incident, and sent him to his cupboard with no food.`, 

`Chapter 3 The Letters From No One:


The next summer, when his punishment had finally wore off, Harry was told to get the mail. Harry notices a letter, addressed to him in “The Cupboard Under the Stairs.” The Dursley’s snatch the letter, and move Harry into a different room. The next day, another letter arrives, this time addressed to “The Smallest Bedroom.” Letters continually came for Harry, until Mr. Dursley nailed the mail-slot shut. More letters came, slipped under the door. The Dursley’s move into a hotel, and then into a isolated small island. At this island Harry realized he would turn eleven in ten minutes. Harry began counting down the time, and as soon midnight came, there was a ground shaking thump on the door.`, 

`Chapter 4 The Keeper of the Keys:

There were two more thumps on the door, waking everyone in the house. Finally, the door was smashed down. A giant, who called himself Hagrid, was holding a birthday cake. Hagrid says he is the keeper of the keys at Hogwarts. Hagrid expected Harry to know what he was talking about. When he didn’t Hagrid was outraged. Hagrid, after screaming at the Dursleys, explains to Harry that he is famous in “their world.” Hagrid explains that Harry is a wizard, and he has been accepted into Hogwarts, the most prestigious wizarding school. Harry at first, is in denial. He then begins to think about it, and realizes the vanishing glass was an act of wizardry. Hagrid takes Harry away with him, as Mr. Dursley protests.

Chapter 5 Diagon Alley:

Harry wakes next to Hagrid, realizing it wasn’t a dream. The two go to London to shop for school supplies. Harry is worried about being able to pay, but Hagrid assures him that his parents have left him plenty of money behind. Their first stop is a pub called the Leaky Cauldron. The people there all recognize Harry, and talk to him. Hagrid goes to the back, taps on a brick wall, and a street opens up. The street is called Diagon Alley. Hagrid explains that he can get his supplies there. Then they go to Gringotts, a wizarding bank. They stop at Harry’s vault, as well as vault 713. Harry questions what is in there, but Hagrid says it is official Hogwarts business. Harry is trying on his clothes, when he meets a rude boy also starting his first wizarding year. Harry worries he won’t be cut out for the wizarding world, but Hagrid reassures him. After getting the required books, and potion ingredients, Harry goes to get his wand. The store owner tells him it will be clear when he has the correct wand. After trying a few, Harry finds the one that is clearly for him. The owner tells him that a wand containing the same phoenix feather had belonged to Voldemort, and had been used against Harry. After this, Harry is sent back to the Dursley’s, set to leave a month later for Hogwarts.`, 

`Chapter 6 The Journey From Platform 9 3/4

Harry’s last month with the Dursley’s was not fun. Mr. Dursley took him to the train station the day he needed to leave. Harry was in search for platform 9 ¾. Standing between 9 and 10, he finally overheard people talk about Hogwarts. He asks them for help, and walks through the brick wall as he is told. On the other side he finds the train to Hogwarts. Once on the train, Harry begins speaking to a boy named Ron. Ron starts explaining things about the wizarding world. Ron is poor, so Harry spreads his newfound wealth. They meet a somewhat annoying girl named Hermione. The train arrives, and they take boats to the castle.`,

`Chapter 7 The Sorting Hat

The students are met by Mcgonagall, who tells them they will be separated into one of the four houses. Each house has its own quidditch team, and are in yearly competitions. The new students enter the main hall, and see a pointy hat sitting on a stool. The hat places them in their house. When Harry goes the hat almost places him in Slytherin. Harry has learned he doesn’t care for that house, so he persuades the hat to pick Gryffindor. Ron and hermione are also placed in that house. The rude boy, Draco Malfoy, from shopping is placed in Slytherin. In the hall they have a great feast. Harry watches the teachers, and he gets a sharp pain in his forehead. Dumbledore, the headmaster, gives a speech. He warns about going to the forbidden forest, and the third-floor corridor on the right side.`,

`Chapter 8 The Potions Master

Harry finds life at Hogwarts strange. Everyone talks about him. Harry likes his classes, except for History of Magic. Only hermione seems to excel. Harry is relieved to see others are confused. Later, in potions class, Harry finds out the teacher, Snape, doesn’t like him. He mocks and humiliates Harry. Harry and Ron have become friends, and they both go to see Hagrid. Hagrid assures Harry that Snape has no reason to hate him. Harry reads an article discussing a break in at Gringotts, vault 713. (The vault he and Hagrid had gone to) Harry leaves with many questions.`,

`Chapter 9 The Midnight Duel

Gryffindor and Slytherin have flying lessons together, which means Harry must see his enemy Draco Malfoy. While at the flying class, a boy named Neville hurts himself. The teacher leaves to take care of Neville. Malfoy takes a ball Neville left behind, and flies around with it. Enraged, Harry flies to catch him. Malfoy throws the ball, and Harry catches it in spectacular fashion. Mrs. Mcgonagall orders Harry to come, and she introduces him to a man named Oliver Wood, captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team. At dinner, Harry tells Ron that he will be on the quidditch team. Malfoy comes over and teases Harry for Mcgonagall catching him. They agree to a duel, in spite of Hermione’s protests. Harry, and Ron go to the duel. Hermione is stuck with them. Malfoy is nowhere to be found, and a caretaker finds them. Scared, the kids run to a forbidden area staring at a scary three headed dog.

They lock the troll in the girls’ bathroom, unknowing that Hermione was in there. Using teamwork, and their magic, they knockout the troll. Mcgonagall finds them, and begins to scold. Hermione interjects and makes up a lie to save Harry and Ron. From this moment the three are friends. They devise a theory that Snape let the troll in to get past the dog.`,

Hermione sets Snape’s robe on fire, and Harry regains control. He catches the snitch, ending the game. Harry, Ron, and Hermione talk to Hagrid, and tell them that Snape was cursing Harry’s broom.
